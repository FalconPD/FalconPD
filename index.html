That’s where hashtags come in. A hashtag is a word of phrase preceded by a “#”. Hashtags help you focus on tweets around a specific topic. You can add a hashtag to any tweet by following the tweet with an appropriate hashtag and it will appear in the group. By putting one of the district hash tags at the end of your tweets you will be participating in our twitter challenge!</p> <p>Here is an example tweet:</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Working on coteaching skills today. Power of two! #FalconPD #education
</code></pre></div> <p>Here are the hashtags we use in-district:</p> <p><strong>#FalconPD</strong>, <strong>#TheresNoPlaceLikeOakTree</strong>, <strong>#ApplegarthFalcons</strong>, <strong>#WLCares</strong>, <strong>#MillLakeIsGreat</strong>, <strong>#BBRocks</strong>, <strong>#WeAreBrookside</strong>, <strong>#FabFalcons</strong>, <strong>#GreatDayToBeAFalcon</strong></p> <p>Get more tips and popular hashtags <a href="http://www.learningunlimitedllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-Tool-4-Learning-Unlimited-by-Kimberly-Tyson.pdf">here</a>.
